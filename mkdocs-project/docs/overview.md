# Learn Excel / Overview

Microsoft Excel is the de facto standard for managing simple datasets and performing analysis on those datasets.
Many people will try to solve every problem with Excel because it provides extensive functionality.
This documentation provides information for how to use Excel for open data access and analysis,
and integration with other tools.

## Alternatives to Excel

Alternatives to Excel should be considered where Excel does not satisfy requirements, for example when:

* datasets are too large for Excel
* Excel formulas, programming, and processing logic become too complex to maintain
* custom user interfaces in Excel are limited (e.g., maps, charts)
* cost of Microsoft Office is an issue

Alternatives to Excel include:

* Relational database or other data management solutions for large datasets
* [TSTool software](http://openwaterfoundation.org/software-tools/tstool) - for time series processing
* [Libre Office Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - open source office suite
* Other alternatives will be added...
